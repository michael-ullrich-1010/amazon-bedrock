# Nuvibit JSON-Engine <a id="nuvibit_json_engine"></a> [🔝](#top)

The principle of the Nuvibit JSON-Engine is based on the comparison of a **Pattern JSON** with a **Source JSON**.

The syntax of the **Pattern JSON** is in alignment with [Amazon EventBridge > Create event patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html#eb-create-pattern):

| Comparison | Example | Rule syntax | Matching source example |
| :---   | :---  | :---  | :---  |
| Equals | Name is "Alice" | "Name": "Alice" or "Name": [ "Alice" ]  | "Name": "Alice" |
| And | Location is "New York" and Day is "Monday" | "Location": "New York", <br/>"Day": "Monday" | "Location": "New York",<br/> "Day": "Monday" |
| Or | PaymentType is "Credit" | "Debit" | "PaymentType": [ "Credit", "Debit"] | "PaymentType": "Credit" |
| Empty | LastName is empty | "LastName": [""] | "LastName": "" |
| "Nesting" | Customer.Name is "Alice" | "Customer": JSON Object | "Customer": { "Name": "Alice" }  |
| Mix | Location is "New York" and Day is "Monday" or "Tuesday" | "Location": "New York", <br/> "Day": ["Monday", "Thuesday"] | "Location": "New York", "Day": "Monday" or <br/> "Location": "New York", "Day": "Tuesday" |
